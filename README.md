# PingPong Game 🏓

Yo! This is a simple Pong game made in Python using Pygame. Just a little arcade throwback you can run and smash that ball around. CPU’s kinda smart, player paddle controls bounce angles — don’t underestimate it.

## How to play
Use *UP / DOWN* arrows to move your paddle.

Bounce the ball off your paddle.

Score points when the CPU misses.

Watch out! CPU can be sneaky but still beatable.

## Notes ⚡

Player paddle controls the bounce angle — hit the ball near edges to curve it.

CPU paddle is somewhat humanized; sometimes it hesitates but its still a clanker.
